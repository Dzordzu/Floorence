# Floorence
Deadly simple, beautiful as hell

## About
The main purpose of the Floorence is to provide simple wrapper for the following: **PJAX**, **Transitions**, **Cache**. Additionally it supports great **error handling** and **extensiblity**.

Currently the library is in its alpha version and probably does NOT work (partially, or at all), depending on the version.

Floorence is the successor of the [Barba.js](https://github.com/luruke/barba.js), which seems to be already dead.
